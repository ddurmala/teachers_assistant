  ## Description
  
  The purpose of this project is to create a database that will allow teachers to view students registered in their class as well as an assigned grade to that student.
  This will allow teacher to more easily track their student's progress during the curriculum.

  Once the teacher registers in the landing page, they are then taking to the Student Menu, from there they can view all of the currently registered students and have options on the left.

  These options include:
  
  -Adding a Student
  -Updating a Student's info
  -Deleting a Student's info
  -Viewing all Students

  When adding a new student, teachers will have to fill out a form with the following:

  The Student element has the following parameters:
  First name,
  Last name,
  Birthdate,
  Grade Level,
  Bus number,
  IEP boolean,
  Behavior Plan boolean,
  1:1 aide,
  Aide name if previous question was true,
  Allergies

  This information will be easily viewable by the teacher once the information is inserted.
